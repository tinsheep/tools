Microsoft Teams Sample Hub overview
=====================================

The Teams Branded Experience (aka Sample Hub), together with custom
line-of-business applications, enable you to quickly present the "art of
the possible" by showcasing the Teams platform and articulating the
value that it can deliver. 

The Sample Hub is a personal-branded landing experience that is pinned to
the Teams mobile app, allowing your organization to provide consolidated
information and the functionality of important first-party and
line-of-business apps to firstline worker employees. Sample Hub can leverage
multiple technologies and capabilities such as the SharePoint Framework
in Teams (SPFx), Microsoft Graph APIs, PowerApps, Web
Apps/HTML/JavaScript, and mobile app pinning to highlight a branded
experience for any user.

The Sample Hub was primarily designed and built as a mobile app and is
currently not optimized for desktop clients.

### Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/msft-teams/tools/blob/master/TeamsSampleHub/SampleHub/Source/wwwroot/images/readmeimages/5.png)

Prerequisites
-------------

    information from Azure AD and Microsoft Graph.

5.  Install your desired custom apps.

![note](https://github.com/msft-teams/tools/blob/master/TeamsSampleHub/SampleHub/Source/wwwroot/images/readmeimages/6.PNG)

Authentication and Single Sign on (SSO)
---------------------------------------

The Sample Hub authentication flow is based on user profile information
stored in Azure AD and accessed using Microsoft Graph.

The Teams [Single Sign-on
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso) is supported now.

[Learn
more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-flow-tab)
about authentication for Microsoft Tabs and SSO in Teams.

Capabilities overview
---------------------

1.  Sample Hub is an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

2.  Access employee Shifts schedules using [Microsoft Teams Shifts Graph API integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/schedule-list-shifts?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).

3.  Display employee tasks using [Microsoft Planner Tasks Graph API
    integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/planneruser-list-tasks?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).

4.  Customize Sample Hub to create a tailored experience. For example:

    -   The announcement feature of the Sample Hub can be integrated with
        our [Company Communicator app
        template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#company-communicator)
        to share your company's the information and notifications within
        the Sample Hub.

    -   [Create Power App
        applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-powerapps/5-powerapps-create-first)
        and
        [deep-link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links)
        to the Sample Hub.

    -   [Build SharePoint Framework application in
        Teams](https://aka.ms/spfx-teams) such as a News app and
        [deep-link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links)
        to the Sample Hub.

5.  Retrieve a list of team members in the same shift by using the
    [Microsoft Graph List Members
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-list-members?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).

6.  Enhance the user chat experience by creating [deep
    links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links#generating-a-deep-link-to-a-chat)
    to private chats within the Sample Hub.

7.  The [Microsoft Graph photo
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profilephoto-get?view=graph-rest-1.0)
    can be called to display a team member's user profile picture.

8.  Get user profile information using the [Microsoft Graph Get User
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).

Deployment
----------

### Register your Sample Hub with Azure AD

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
2. Select **New Registration** and on the *register an application page*, set following values:
    * Set **name** to your app name.
    * Choose the **supported account types** (any account type will work)
    * Leave **Redirect URI** empty.
    * Choose **Register**.
3. On the overview page, copy and save the **Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID**. You’ll need those later when updating your Teams application manifest and in the appsettings.json.
4. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**. 
5. Select the **Set** link to generate the Application ID URI in the form of `api://{AppID}`. Insert your fully qualified domain name (with a forward slash "/" appended to the end) between the double forward slashes and the GUID. The entire ID should have the form of: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/{AppID}`
    * ex: `api://subdomain.example.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
6. Select the **Add a scope** button. In the panel that opens, enter `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.
7. Set **Who can consent?** to `Admins and users`
8. Fill in the fields for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user` scope:
    * **Admin consent title:** Teams can access the user’s profile.
    * **Admin consent description**: Allows Teams to call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
    * **User consent title**: Teams can access the user profile and make requests on the user's behalf.
    * **User consent description:** Enable Teams to call this app’s APIs with the same rights as the user.
9. Ensure that **State** is set to **Enabled**
10. Select **Add scope**
    * The domain part of the **Scope name** displayed just below the text field should automatically match the **Application ID** URI set in the previous step, with `/access_as_user` appended to the end:
        * `api://subdomain.example.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/access_as_user`
11. In the **Authorized client applications** section, identify the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application. Each of the following IDs needs to be entered:
    * `1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264` (Teams mobile/desktop application)
    * `5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346` (Teams web application)
12. Navigate to **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the follow permissions:
-   Select Add a permission
-   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Delegated permissions.
    * User.Read (enabled by default)
    * email
    * offline_access
    * OpenId
    * profile
    * Group.Read.All
    * User.Read.All
-   Select Microsoft Graph -\> Application permissions.    
    * User.ReadWrite.All
    * Directory.Read.All
    * Group.Read.All
-   Click on Add permissions. Please make sure to grant the admin consent for the required permissions.
13. Navigate to **Authentication**
    If an app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, users will have to provide consent the first time they use an app.
    Set a redirect URI:
    * Select **Add a platform**.
    * Select **web**.
    * Enter the **redirect URI** for the app in the following format: https://%appDomain%.azurewebsites.net/End. This will be the page where a successful implicit grant flow will redirect the user.
     
        * `Note, Redirect URI can be set post deployment also, if the appDomain is not available yet.`
         
    Enable implicit grant by checking the following boxes:  
    ✔ ID Token  
    ✔ Access Token  
14.  Navigate to the **Certificates & secrets**. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description      (Name of the secret) for the secret and select “Never” for Expires. Click "Add". Once the client secret is created, copy its value, it need to be placed in the appsettings.json.

### Create a Sample Hub Teams app manifest

[Create an app package for the Sample Hub
app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package).
Apps in Teams are defined by an app manifest JSON file and bundled in an
app package with their icons. You\'ll need an app package to upload and
install your app in Teams, and to publish to either your Line of
Business app catalog or to AppSource.
